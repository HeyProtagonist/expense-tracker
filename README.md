As always it's react application using typescript and tailwindcss.
It is integrated with `@reduxjs/toolkit@latest`.
So, React-Query is possible.

# **Installation**

npx degit https://github.com/retr0c0de/expend-inator my-app

```bash
  cd my-app
  yarn
```

```bash
Development  : yarn dev
Production   : yarn build
Prod Preview : yarn serve
```

# Issues [2021/06/29]

This application hasn't optimized. That is it's not for production and
well it is intentional.

![yep!](https://media.giphy.com/media/JeMOaDsmCnJvHd7OJR/giphy-downsized.gif)

Yes, there are two packages included 'react-charts-js-2' & 'react-icons'.
For whatever reason. It gave an nearly 500KB assets. But the app is working fine.
Yet we know it's not an efficient approach for a simple project.

So, I'll optimize as much as possible by learning something new.
If anyone got gist about this project. I'll appreciate for a advice!
